1)the persistence layer delete expired sessions by checking each elements in the session data, checking for expiry date, and creating a new array (temp)  that include the non-expired sessions. the 'session.json' file is updated with the non-expired sessions when expired ones are deleted.

2)By efficiently filtering out expired sessions and updating the file to remove them, the system is able to return the active session linked to the provided key (if it has not expired) or return 'undefined' if no valid session is found. This process seamlessly combines both session cleanup and retrieval in a single, streamlined step.
